<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  With no intentions of ever being on a computer, I started my journey in design as a kid in vandalism and graffiti.
I was never as good as some of my peers (not as bad either), but I stayed consistent and kept at it until it led me here.

  In 1992-ish, I got my first job and was put to "type" on an Apple Macintosh Centris 610. I was awestruck immediately
  I was allowed to stay after closing to play with the computer, so I would stay late nights and get back to school in the morning
  then after school go to work and do it all over again.

  Eventually, I stumbled into teh entertainment industry... and by stumbled - I mean it was a total accident, and now - here I am.
